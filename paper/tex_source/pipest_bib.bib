abstract = {We study the price impact of order book events—limit orders, market orders, and cancellations—using the NYSE Trades and Quotes data for fifty U.S. stocks. We show that, over short time intervals, price changes are mainly driven by the order flow imbalance (OFI), defined as the imbalance between supply and demand at the best bid and ask prices. Our study reveals a linear relation between OFI and price changes, with a slope inversely proportional to the market depth. These results are shown to be robust to intraday seasonality effects, and stable across time scales and across stocks. This linear price impact model, together with a scaling argument, implies the empirically observed “square-root” relation between the magnitude of price moves and trading volume, but this relation is found to be noisy and less robust than the one based on OFI. We discuss a potential application of OFI as a measure of adverse selection in limit order executions and discuss the implications for intraday volatility dynamics.},

These are statistically reconstructed based on information about market member codes using data from the Spanish Stock Market and the London Stock Exchange. We find that market impact is strongly concave, approximately increasing as the square root of order size. Furthermore, as a given order is executed, the impact grows in time according to a power law; after the order is finished, it reverts to a level of about 0.5-0.7 of its value at its peak. We observe that hidden orders are executed at a rate that more or less matches trading in the overall market, except for small deviations at the beginning and end of the order.},

The usual straightforward simulation algorithm suffers from edge effects, whereas our perfect simulation algorithm does not. By viewing Hawkes processes as Poisson cluster processes and using their branching and conditional independence structures, useful approximations of the distribution function for the length of a cluster are derived. This is used to construct upper and lower processes for the perfect simulation algorithm. A tail-lightness condition turns out to be of importance for the applicability of the perfect simulation algorithm. Examples of applications and empirical results are presented.},

Our study is based on an empirical investigation reported in Teverovsky, Taqqu and Willinger [33] of the modified rescaled adjusted range or R/S statistic that was proposed by Lo [17] as a test for long-range dependence with good robustness properties under “extra” short-range dependence. Our main conclusion is that because the modified R/S statistic shows a strong preference for accepting the null hypothesis of no long-range dependence, irrespective of whether long-range dependence is present in the data or not, Lo's acceptance of the hypothesis for the CRSP data (i.e., no long-range dependence in stock market prices) is less conclusive than is usually regarded in the econometrics literature. In fact, upon further analysis of the data, we find empirical evidence of long-range dependence in stock price returns, but because the corresponding degree of long-range dependence (measured via the Hurst parameter H ) is typically very low (i.e., H -values around 0.60), the evidence is not absolutely conclusive.},

	abstract = {Execution traders know that market impact greatly depends on whether their orders lean with or against the market. We introduce the OEH model, which incorporates this fact when determining the optimal trading horizon for an order, an input required by many sophisticated execution strategies. This model exploits the trader's private information about her trade's side and size, and how it will shift the prevailing order flow. From a theoretical perspective, OEH explains why market participants may rationally “dump” their orders in an increasingly illiquid market. We argue that trade side and order imbalance are key variables needed for modeling market impact functions, and their dismissal may be the reason behind the apparent disagreement in the literature regarding the functional form of the market impact function. We show that in terms of its information ratio OEH performs better than participation rate schemes and VWAP strategies. Our backtests suggest that OEH contributes substantial “execution alpha” for a wide variety of futures contracts. An implementation of OEH is provided in Python language.},

Informational footprint is related to order flow and is represented by the trader's influence on the flow imbalance process, while microstructure influence is captured by instantaneous price impact. We propose a continuous-time stochastic control problem that balances between these two costs. Incorporating order flow imbalance leads to the consideration of the current market state and specifically whether one's orders lean with or against the prevailing order flow, key components often ignored by execution models in the literature. In particular, to react to changing order flow, we endogenize the trading horizon $T$. After developing the general indefinite-horizon formulation, we investigate several tractable approximations that sequentially optimize over price impact and over $T$. These approximations, especially a dynamic version based on receding horizon control, are shown to be very accurate and connect to the prevailing Almgren--Chriss framework, as well as features of empirical order flow, and the model presented in Optimal Execution Horizon by Easley, Lopez de Prado, and O'Hara [ Math.

Imposing that any market taking or liquidity providing strategies is at best marginally profitable, we obtain a linear relation between the bid–ask spread and the instantaneous impact of market orders, in good agreement with our empirical observations on electronic markets. We then use this relation to justify a strong, and hitherto unnoticed, empirical correlation between the spread and the volatility per trade , with R 2 s exceeding 0.9. This correlation suggests both that the main determinant of the bid–ask spread is adverse selection, and that most of the volatility comes from trade impact. We argue that the role of the time-horizon appearing in the definition of costs is crucial and that long-range correlations in the order flow, overlooked in previous studies, must be carefully factored in. We find that the spread is significantly larger on the NYSE, a liquid market with specialists, where monopoly rents appear to be present.},

abstract = {<p>We use high-frequency data from the Nasdaq exchange to build a measure of volume imbalance in the limit order (LO) book. We show that our measure is a good predictor of the sign of the next market order (MO), i.e., buy or sell, and also helps to predict price changes immediately after the arrival of an MO. Based on these empirical findings, we introduce and calibrate a Markov chain-modulated pure jump model of price, spread, LO and MO arrivals and volume imbalance. As an application of the model, we pose and solve a stochastic control problem for an agent who maximizes terminal wealth, subject to inventory penalties, by executing trades using LOs. We use in-sample-data (January to June 2014) to calibrate the model to 11 equities traded in the Nasdaq exchange and use out-of-sample data (July to December 2014) to test the performance of the strategy. We show that introducing our volume imbalance measure into the optimization problem considerably boosts the profits of the strategy....},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning is explored as a candidate machine learning technique to enhance existing analytical solutions for optimal trade execution with elements from the market microstructure. Given a volume-to-trade, fixed time horizon and discrete trading periods, the aim is to adapt a given volume trajectory such that it is dynamic with respect to favourable/unfavourable conditions during realtime execution, thereby improving overall cost of trading. We consider the standard Almgren-Chriss model with linear price impact as a candidate base model. This model is popular amongst sell-side institutions as a basis for arrival price benchmark execution algorithms. By training a learning agent to modify a volume trajectory based on the market's prevailing spread and volume dynamics, we are able to improve post-trade implementation shortfall by up to 10.3% on average compared to the base model, based on a sample of stocks and trade sizes in the South African equity market.},

	abstract = {et al.H From an analysis of the time series of realized variance using recent high-frequency data, Gatheral et al. [Volatility is rough, 2014] previously showed that the logarithm of realized variance behaves essentially as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent H of order 0.1, at any reasonable timescale. The resulting Rough Fractional Stochastic Volatility (RFSV) model is remarkably consistent with financial time series data. We now show how the RFSV model can be used to price claims on both the underlying and integrated variance. We analyse in detail a simple case of this model, the rBergomi model. In particular, we find that the rBergomi model fits the SPX volatility markedly better than conventional Markovian stochastic volatility models, and with fewer parameters. Finally, we show that actual SPX variance swap curves seem to be consistent with model forecasts, with particular dramatic examples from the weekend of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the Flash Crash.},

These prices permit an equilibrium valuation of assets with uncertain payoffs at many future dates. Furthermore, for any given portfolio, the price of a $1.00 claim received at a future date, if the portfolio's value is between two given levels at that time, is derived explicitly from a second partial derivative of its call-option pricing function. An intertemporal capital asset pricing model is derived for payoffs that are jointly lognormally distributed with aggregate consumption. It is shown that using the Black-Scholes equation for options on aggregate consumption implies that individuals' preferences aggregate to isoelastic utility.},

An agent assumes this volatility to be a specific function of time and the stock price, knowing that this assumption may result in a misspecification of the volatility. However, if the misspecified volatility dominates the true volatility, then the misspecified price of the option dominates its true price. Moreover, the option hedging strategy computed under the assumption of the misspecified volatility provides an almost sure one‐sided hedge for the option under the true volatility. Analogous results hold if the true volatility dominates the misspecified volatility. These comparisons can fail, however, if the misspecified volatility is not assumed to be a function of time and the stock price. The positive results, which apply to both European and American options, are used to obtain a bound and hedge for Asian options.",

Denote by $G_T(\Theta )$ the space of all random variables $(\theta \cdot X)_T$ , where $\theta $ is a predictable $X$ -integrable process such that the stochastic integral $\theta \cdot X$ is in the space ${\cal S} ^2$ of semimartingales. We investigate under which conditions on the semimartingale $X$ the space $G_T(\Theta )$ is closed in ${\cal L} ^2(\Omega , {\cal F} ,P)$ , a question which arises naturally in the applications to financial mathematics. Our main results give necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the closedness of $G_T(\Theta )$ in ${\cal L} ^2(P)$ . Most of these conditions deal with BMO -martingales and reverse Hölder inequalities which are equivalent to weighted norm inequalities. By means of these last inequalities, we also extend previous results on the Föllmer-Schweizer decomposition.",

	pages={141-183},
	abstract={The long history of the theory of option pricing began in 1900 when the French mathematician Louis Bachelier deduced an option pricing formula based on the assumption that stock prices follow a Brownian motion with zero drift. Since that time, numerous researchers have contributed to the theory. The present paper begins by deducing a set of restrictions on option pricing formulas from the assumption that investors prefer more to less. These restrictions are necessary conditions for a formula to be consistent with a rational pricing theory. Attention is given to the problems created when dividends are paid on the underlying common stock and when the terms of the option contract can be changed explicitly by a change in exercise price or implicitly by a shift in the investment or capital structure policy of the firm. Since the deduced restrictions are not sufficient to uniquely determine an option pricing formula, additional assumptions are introduced to examine and extend the seminal Black-Scholes theory of option pricing. Explicit formulas for pricing both call and put options as well as for warrants and the new "down-and-out" option are derived. The effects of dividends and call provisions on the warrant price are examined. The possibilities for further extension of the theory to the pricing of corporate liabilities are discussed.},

We consider an idealized financial security with continuous price paths, without making any stochastic assumptions. It is shown that typical price paths possess quadratic variation, where “typical” is understood in the following game-theoretic sense: there exists a trading strategy that earns infinite capital without risking more than one monetary unit if the process of quadratic variation does not exist. Replacing time by the quadratic variation process, we show that the price path becomes Brownian motion. This is essentially the same conclusion as in the Dubins–Schwarz result, except that the probabilities (constituting the Wiener measure) emerge instead of being postulated. We also give an elegant statement, inspired by Peter McCullagh’s unpublished work, of this result in terms of game-theoretic probability theory.},

	abstract={Given a Gaussian process $X$, its canonical geometric rough path lift $\mathbf{X}$, and a solution $Y$ to the rough differential equation $\mathrm{d}Y{t} = V\left (Y_{t}\right ) \circ \mathrm{d} \mathbf{X}_t$, we present a closed-form correction formula for $\int Y_t \circ \mathrm{d} \mathbf{X}_t - \int Y_t \, \mathrm{d} X_t$, i.e. the difference between the rough and Skorohod integrals of $Y$ with respect to $X$. When $X$ is standard Brownian motion, we recover the classical Stratonovich-to-It{\o} conversion formula, which we generalize to Gaussian rough paths with finite $p$-variation for $1 \leq p < 3$, and Volterra Gaussian rough paths for $3 \leq p < 4$. This encompasses many familiar examples, including fractional Brownian motion with $H > \frac{1}{4}$. It\{o}'s formula can also be recovered in the case when $Y_t = \nabla f( X_t)$ for some smooth $f$. \par To prove the formula, we show that $\int Y_t \, \mathrm{d} X_t$ is the $L2(\Omega)$ limit of its Riemann-sum approximants, and that the approximants can be appended with a suitable compensation term without altering the limit. To show convergence of the Riemann-sum approximants, we utilize a novel characterization of the Cameron-Martin norm using multi-dimensional Young-Stieltjes integrals. For the main theorem, complementary regularity between the Cameron-Martin paths and the covariance function of $X$ is used to show the existence of these integrals. However, it turns out not to be a necessary condition, as we provide a new set of conditions for their existence, as well as provide a new formulation of the classical It\{o}-Skorohod isometry in terms of these Young-Stieltjes integrals.},

The SPDE may be viewed as an infinite-dimensional analogue of the Langevin equation used in finite-dimensional sampling. In this paper, conditioned nonlinear SDEs, leading to nonlinear SPDEs for the sampling, are studied. In addition, a class of preconditioned SPDEs is studied, found by applying a Green's operator to the SPDE in such a way that the invariant measure remains unchanged; such infinite dimensional evolution equations are important for the development of practical algorithms for sampling infinite dimensional problems. The resulting SPDEs provide several significant challenges in the theory of SPDEs. The two primary ones are the presence of nonlinear boundary conditions, involving first order derivatives, and a loss of the smoothing property in the case of the pre-conditioned SPDEs. These challenges are overcome and a theory of existence, uniqueness and ergodicity is developed in sufficient generality to subsume the sampling problems of interest to us. The Gaussian theory developed in Part I of this paper considers Gaussian SDEs, leading to linear Gaussian SPDEs for sampling. This Gaussian theory is used as the basis for deriving nonlinear SPDEs which affect the desired sampling in the nonlinear case, via a change of measure.},

	abstract={We use the modified Black-Scholes model and a random variance option pricing model to study prices of European currency options traded in Geneva. The options, which cannot be exercised early, include calls and puts on the dollar/Swiss franc exchange rate. In the empirical analysis, we examine the model fit and the biases with respect to the strike price, time to maturity, and volatility. There is some evidence of mispricing and there are small gains available by trading with the random variance model.},

	abstract={In this paper, Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods are exploited to provide a unified, practical likelihood-based framework for the analysis of stochastic volatility models. A highly effective method is developed that samples all the unobserved volatilities at once using an approximating offset mixture model, followed by an importance reweighting procedure. This approach is compared with several alternative methods using real data. The paper also develops simulation-based methods for filtering, likelihood evaluation and model failure diagnostics. The issue of model choice using non-nested likelihood ratios and Bayes factors is also investigated. These methods are used to compare the fit of stochastic volatility and GARCH models. All the procedures are illustrated in detail.},

	title={A Martingale Approach for Fractional Brownian Motions and Related Path Dependent PDEs},
	abstract={In this paper we study dynamic backward problems, with the computation of conditional expectations as a main objective, in a framework where the (forward) state process satisfies a Volterra type SDE, with fractional Brownian motion as a typical example. Such processes are neither Markov processes nor semimartingales, and most notably, they feature a certain time inconsistency which makes any direct application of Markovian ideas, such as flow properties, impossible without passing to a path-dependent framework. Our main result is a functional It\^{o} formula, extending the seminal work of Dupire \cite{Dupire} to our more general framework. In particular, unlike in \cite{Dupire} where one needs only to consider the stopped paths, here we need to concatenate the observed path up to the current time with a certain smooth observable curve derived from the distribution of the future paths. This new feature is due to the time inconsistency involved in this paper. We then derive the path dependent PDEs for the backward problems.

	title={A theory of {Hypoellipticity} and unique {Ergodicity} for semilinear stochastic {PDEs}},
	abstract={We present a theory of hypoellipticity and unique ergodicity for semilinear parabolic stochastic PDEs with "polynomial" nonlinearities and additive noise, considered as abstract evolution equations in some Hilbert space. It is shown that if Hörmander's bracket condition holds at every point of this Hilbert space, then a lower bound on the Malliavin covariance operatorμt can be obtained. Informally, this bound can be read as "Fix any finite-dimensional projection on a subspace of sufficiently regular functions. Then the eigenfunctions of μt with small eigenvalues have only a very small component in the image of Π." We also show how to use a priori bounds on the solutions to the equation to obtain good control on the dependency of the bounds on the Malliavin matrix on the initial condition. These bounds are sufficient in many cases to obtain the asymptotic strong Feller property introduced in [HM06]. One of the main novel technical tools is an almost sure bound from below on the size of "Wiener polynomials," where the coefficients are possibly non-adapted stochastic processes satisfying a Lips chitz condition. By exploiting the polynomial structure of the equations, this result can be used to replace Norris' lemma, which is unavailable in the present context. We conclude by showing that the two-dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations and a large class of reaction-diffusion equations fit the framework of our theory.},

We revisit and extend some recent ground-breaking work of Cass-Litterer-Lyons in this regard; as by-product, we obtain a user-friendly "transitivity property" of such integrability estimates. We also consider rough integrals; as a novel application, uniform Weibull tail estimates for a class of (random) rough integrals are obtained. A concrete example arises from the stochastic heat-equation, spatially mollified by hyper-viscosity, and we can recover (in fact: sharpen) a technical key result of [Hairer, Comm.PureAppl.Math.64,no.11,(2011),1547-1585].},

	abstract={This paper introduces in detail a new systematic method to construct approximate finite-dimensional solutions for the nonlinear filtering problem. Once a finite-dimensional family is selected, the nonlinear filtering equation is projected in Fisher metric on the corresponding manifold of densities, yielding the projection filter for the chosen family. The general definition of the projection filter is given, and its structure is explored in detail for exponential families. Particular exponential families which optimize the correction step in the case of discrete-time observations are given, and an a posteriori estimate of the local error resulting from the projection is defined. Simulation results comparing the projection filter and the optimal filter for the cubic sensor problem are presented. The classical concept of assumed density filter (ADF) is compared with the projection filter. It is shown that the concept of ADF is inconsistent in the sense that the resulting filters depend on the choice of a stochastic calculus, i.e. the {It\^{o}} or the Stratonovich calculus. It is shown that in the context of exponential families, the projection filter coincides with the Stratonovich-based ADF. An example is provided, which shows that this does not hold in general, for non-exponential families of densities.},

	volume={28},
	abstract={  (ProQuest: ... denotes formulae and/or non-USASCII text omitted; see image) We examine some differential geometric approaches to finding approximate solutions to the continuous time nonlinear filtering problem. Our primary focus is a new projection method for the optimal filter infinite-dimensional stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE), based on the direct ... metric and on a family of normal mixtures. This results in a new finite-dimensional approximate filter based on the differential geometric approach to statistics. We compare this new filter to earlier projection methods based on the Hellinger distance/Fisher metric and exponential families, and compare the ... mixture projection filter with a particle method with the same number of parameters, using the Levy metric. We discuss differences between projecting the SPDE for the normalized density, known as Kushner-Stratonovich equation, and the SPDE for the unnormalized density known as Zakai equation. We prove that for a simple choice of the mixture manifold the ... mixture projection filter coincides with a Galerkin method, whereas for more general mixture manifolds the equivalence does not hold and the ... mixture filter is more general. We study particular systems that may illustrate the advantages of this new filter over other algorithms when comparing outputs with the optimal filter. We finally consider a specific software design that is suited for a numerically efficient implementation of this filter and provide numerical examples. We leverage an algebraic ring structure by proving that in presence of a given structure in the system coefficients the key integrations needed to implement the new filter equations can be executed offline.},

	abstract = {Execution traders know that market impact greatly depends on whether their orders lean with or against the market. We introduce the OEH model, which incorporates this fact when determining the optimal trading horizon for an order, an input required by many sophisticated execution strategies. This model exploits the trader's private information about her trade's side and size, and how it will shift the prevailing order flow. From a theoretical perspective, OEH explains why market participants may rationally “dump” their orders in an increasingly illiquid market. We argue that trade side and order imbalance are key variables needed for modeling market impact functions, and their dismissal may be the reason behind the apparent disagreement in the literature regarding the functional form of the market impact function. We show that in terms of its information ratio OEH performs better than participation rate schemes and VWAP strategies. Our backtests suggest that OEH contributes substantial “execution alpha” for a wide variety of futures contracts. An implementation of OEH is provided in Python language.},
