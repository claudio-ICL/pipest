I am calibrating on lobster
symbol=INTC, date=2019-01-04, time_window=36000-38000
event type: 0
Calibration is being performed on the following machine:
 posix.uname_result(sysname='Linux', nodename='cx3-1-10.cx3.hpc.ic.ac.uk', release='4.18.0-147.5.1.el8_1.x86_64', version='#1 SMP Wed Feb 5 02:00:39 UTC 2020', machine='x86_64')
Partial calibration for event_type=0
mle_estimation.EstimProcedure is being initialised
EstimProcedure has been successfully initialised
I am setting the estimation of hawkes parameters, with time_start=0.009498990002612118, time_end=1999.966535245003.
The boundaries of arrival times are 0.009498990002612118-1999.966535245003
I am estimating hawkes parameters for the component e=0
